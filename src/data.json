The primary goal is to use DPGs as a tool to improve the weather and climate services by broadening and enhancing access to and utility of data, tools and infrastructure in Tanzania and Malawi (more countries may be included), as well as improvement related to heightened competencies at TMA and DCCMS. The improved services should support the achievement of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), provide socio-economic benefits for Tanzania and Malawi, and make TMA and DCCMS better equipped to adequately respond to ever increasing demand of timely and high resolution weather and climate information in the context of a changing climate and thus handle competition from global actors in the weather enterprise.",
